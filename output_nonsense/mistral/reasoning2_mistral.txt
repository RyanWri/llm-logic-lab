Sentence: After the rain, Sarah ntaltk her umbrella before gkiweh the office.
Reasoning:
1. Reasoning step 1: The first step is to understand that after it rains, people usually carry an umbrella to protect themselves from getting wet. Since Sarah was out during the rain and she has an umbrella, it can be inferred that she used her umbrella.

2. Reasoning step 2: In most cases, once a person is done using their umbrella after the rain, they would put it away or store it safely until the next time it rains. Since Sarah has an umbrella and it has just stopped raining, it can be inferred that she might put her umbrella away.

3. Reasoning step 3: The final step is to consider where Sarah would typically put her umbrella after putting it away. An office environment is often a place where personal belongings like an umbrella are kept. Since Sarah is going to the office and she has an umbrella with her, it can be inferred that she will leave (ntaltk) her umbrella before entering the office.

These three reasoning steps suggest that after the rain, Sarah used her umbrella and then left (ntaltk) her umbrella somewhere safe (most likely at the office) before entering the office.
