Prompt: Does the sentence 'The chicken is ready to eat' mean the chicken is a meal or that it is about to eat something?
Response:
 The sentence 'The chicken is ready to eat' can be interpreted in two ways, depending on the context. It can imply that the chicken has been cooked and prepared as a meal, ready for consumption. However, it could also suggest that the chicken is about to eat something, assuming the context is about an animal rather than food. To avoid ambiguity, it would be clearer to say either "The chicken is ready to be eaten" or "The chicken is about to eat."
