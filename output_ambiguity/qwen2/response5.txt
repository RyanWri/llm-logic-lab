Prompt: Does 'with a telescope' describe how she saw the man or describe the man?
Response:
The phrase "with a telescope" typically describes the means or tool used by her to see the man, rather than describing any characteristics of the man himself. In this context, it indicates that she was able to observe the man using a telescope, suggesting possibly that he is far away, obscured in detail, part of a larger scene, or possibly even hidden from normal view without the use of optical instruments like telescopes.

Here's an example sentence illustrating its usage:

"From her high window, she watched the man walk down the street with a telescope, trying to identify any details that could help solve the mystery."

In this case, "with a telescope" tells us about her method of observation rather than describing the man.
