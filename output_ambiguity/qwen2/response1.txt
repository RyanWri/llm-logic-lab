Prompt: Does the sentence 'The chicken is ready to eat' mean the chicken is a meal or that it is about to eat something?
Response:
The sentence "The chicken is ready to eat" implies that the chicken, which suggests it refers to a cooked dish made with chicken as the main ingredient rather than referring to an individual live chicken, can be served and consumed. It means that the chicken dish is prepared and suitable for eating at this moment.

If you were to interpret it in terms of a single living chicken, the phrase would likely need additional context because chickens do not eat food in the sense humans understand it. Chickens are birds that consume feed or other foods as part of their natural diet. The sentence wouldn't typically be used in that way unless speaking metaphorically.

In summary:
- It does NOT mean the chicken is about to eat something (because chickens don't 'eat' food in this context).
- It does NOT mean that the chicken itself will become a meal.
  
Instead, it means the dish of cooked chicken is prepared and can be eaten.
