Sentence: The plant died because Jenny forgot to open the curtains for a week.
Reasoning:
 1st Reasoning Step:

Jenny's usual routine includes opening the curtains every day to allow sunlight into the room where the plant is kept, promoting photosynthesis and maintaining an adequate light level for the plant's health. By not opening the curtains for a week, Jenny disrupted this routine, denying the plant of essential sunlight required for its survival.

2nd Reasoning Step:

Prolonged lack of sunlight can have detrimental effects on most plants, leading to their gradual weakening and eventual death if the condition continues over a period. Since Jenny's action led to the absence of sunlight for an extended duration (one week), it is reasonable to infer that this may have been enough time for the plant to become weakened and die due to lack of light.

3rd Reasoning Step:

Upon further investigation, if we find that there were no other factors contributing to the death of the plant (e.g., improper watering, pests, or disease), it is highly likely that Jenny's failure to open the curtains for a week was the primary cause of the plant's demise. This conclusion can be strengthened by testing the hypothesis in the future: if Jenny resumes opening the curtains consistently and the plant begins to recover, it would further support this reasoning.
