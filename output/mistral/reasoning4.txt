Sentence: She put the groceries away before the ice cream melted.
Reasoning:
 1. The ice cream would melt if it was left out at room temperature, and its melting is undesirable as it could cause mess and waste.

2. Putting the groceries away provides a cooler environment for them, as cupboards or refrigerators are often cooler than room temperature. This means that putting the ice cream away would slow down its melting process.

3. Therefore, by putting the groceries away before the ice cream melted, she ensured that the ice cream did not melt too quickly or at all while she was handling other tasks, thereby preserving it and preventing a mess.
