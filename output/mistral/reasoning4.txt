Sentence: She put the groceries away before the ice cream melted.
Reasoning:
 1. Step 1: Observation - The ice cream was not melted after she put the groceries away, indicating that it was kept at a temperature below its melting point.

2. Step 2: Assumption - To ensure that the ice cream remained frozen and did not melt, it is reasonable to assume that she placed the ice cream in a cool location or refrigerator before the time elapsed for it to melt.

3. Step 3: Inference - Since the ice cream was put in a cool place and the groceries were being away at the same time, it can be concluded that she must have put the groceries away before the ice cream had enough time to start melting, demonstrating her thoughtfulness and planning skills.
