Sentence: John couldn't find his glasses while they were on his head.
Reasoning:
 Step 1: Observation - John claimed that he couldn't find his glasses, suggesting a lack of visual aid or clarity in his vision.

Step 2: Hypothesis - Since John was unable to locate the glasses, it could be inferred that they are not within the usual places where he might have left them. This is based on the assumption that if they were readily visible, John would likely recognize them and find them.

Step 3: Conclusion - The glasses being on his head during the search process explains why John couldn't find them initially. Since glasses are not typically worn on one's head while searching for them, the confusion arises because the glasses appear to be missing despite being in plain sight (on his own head). This realization dispels the initial hypothesis that the glasses were misplaced and supports the final conclusion: John couldn't find his glasses because they were already on his head.
