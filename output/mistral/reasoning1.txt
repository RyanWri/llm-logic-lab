Sentence: After the rain, Sarah grabbed her umbrella before leaving the office.
Reasoning:
 1. The rain occurred - This can be inferred from the fact that Sarah grabs her umbrella, which is typically used during or after rain.

2. Sarah was at the office when it rained - This can be deduced because she grabbed her umbrella before leaving the office, indicating that she was there during the rain.

3. Sarah left the office after the rain - Since she grabbed her umbrella before leaving, it means she has plans or a need to leave, and since she used her umbrella, it implies that the rain had stopped or was subsiding enough for her to travel.
