Sentence: Tom can't go to his sister's wedding because he's studying abroad in Japan.
Reasoning:
1. **Spatial Distance and Transportation Constraints**: The first step is acknowledging that the physical distance between Tom's location (studying abroad in Japan) and the venue of his sister's wedding poses a significant barrier. Traveling from Japan to another country, especially considering international travel restrictions or complexities during certain times (like weddings), requires substantial time, resources, and logistical planning which might not be feasible within the given timeframe.

2. **Time Zone Differences**: The second reasoning step involves understanding that differences in time zones between Japan and the location of the wedding can affect Tom's ability to attend virtually or participate directly at a convenient time. Depending on when the wedding occurs relative to his local time, there may not be an opportunity for him to join without significantly disrupting his schedule, particularly if he is in the midst of intensive studies or other commitments.

3. **Study and Personal Commitment Prioritization**: The final step involves considering Tom's priorities while studying abroad. Given that attending a wedding might divert from academic responsibilities, personal commitments, and/or the need for rest and recovery during potentially intense study periods (e.g., exams, projects), it becomes more logical to conclude that he cannot attend due to prioritizing his studies over other events or obligations. This prioritization is often crucial in academic settings where time management and focus on education are highly valued.

These reasoning steps collectively support the conclusion that Tom's current situation of studying abroad precludes him from attending his sister's wedding due to practical, logistical, and personal priority constraints.
