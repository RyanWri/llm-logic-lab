Sentence: The plant died because Jenny forgot to open the curtains for a week.
Reasoning:
1. **Assumption of Light Dependency**: Reasoning step 1 begins by considering the fundamental biological need of plants for light. Plants require sunlight to perform photosynthesis, which is crucial for their growth and survival. This process involves capturing energy from sunlight using chlorophyll in leaves, converting it into chemical energy through a series of biochemical reactions.

2. **Connection between Light Exposure and Plant Health**: Given that plants rely on sunlight for photosynthesis, reasoning step 2 connects the lack of light exposure to potential detrimental effects on plant health. The curtains Jenny forgot to open would block natural light from entering the space where the plant is located. Over time, this could lead to a significant decrease in the amount of available sunlight reaching the plant's leaves and stems.

3. **Conclusion on Plant Death**: Finally, reasoning step 3 synthesizes previous information by concluding that the lack of light due to closed curtains likely caused the plant to stop photosynthesizing effectively. This would result in reduced growth and eventually death, as the plant is unable to obtain sufficient energy or may suffer from other physiological issues related to the absence of sunlight (e.g., increased susceptibility to diseases, lack of water uptake, etc.). 

Thus, by logically connecting these reasoning steps, we can conclude that Jenny's oversight led to the plant's demise due to its inability to receive essential light required for photosynthesis.
